The diversity of these restaurants needs to be similar to Manhattan. Their belief is, that by offering a vegan restaurant in a city with a similar mix of venues to Manhattan, we will build upon our current success.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe project will utilize FourSquares database to pull Restaurant data for a list of prospective Cities both in the USA and overseas. With this dataset we can implement a machine learning algorithm to cluster these cities based on Restaurant Categories. Then by reviewing what has been grouped with our Target City - New York we can offer up new locations for business expansion.\n<br>\n",

But how does a company choose the optimum city ? \n<br>When coming to us they realized that they needed to take the gut feeling out of the equation. By implementing an unsupervised machine learning algorithm we can perform the selection without human bias and purely on statistics.\n\n\nThey knew they were successful in New York, NY, therfore the goal is to find another city which is like New York, NY. Whilst there are many alogorithms which can find similarities we chose to use the tried and tested K Nearest Neighbor (KNN). This would allow us to pick multiple Ks and arrive at one which pick a small amount of new cities to go after. Since we are exanding within the Food business we can utilize the FourSquare Database to give us access to the restaurants within major cities. Thus allowing KNN to analyse and produce a report of cities which are most like New York, NY.\n\nWhen running KNN with K=5 the alogrithm returns one city worth exanding into - Cardiff, UK.\n\nWe were interested also in other options but interestingly using K=4 still only Cardiff, UK was grouped with New York, NY. It was only once K=3 was run we ended up with multiple options, but now we had 5 citys within this group - leading us to the conclusion - Cardiff is the correct answer and more analysis is required to pick less other contenders.\n",
